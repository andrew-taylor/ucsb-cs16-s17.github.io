<b>PLEASE MARK YOUR HOMEWORK CLEARLY, REGARDLESS OF IF YOU WRITE IT OUT IN INK OR PENCIL!</b>


1.(18 pts) What member functions do the following in C++11? Show the usual parameters/arguments, if any:
 Opens a file in ofstream classes:
 <div style="margin-bottom:2em"></div>

 Opens a file in ifstream classes:
 <div style="margin-bottom:2em"></div>

 Closes a file in ofstream classes:
 <div style="margin-bottom:2em"></div>

 Checks to see if opening an input file failed in ifstream classes:
 <div style="margin-bottom:2em"></div>

 Returns the position in the input file where you want to start reading in ifstream classes:
 <div style="margin-bottom:2em"></div>

 Returns the position in the output sequence in ofstream classes:
 <div style="margin-bottom:2em"></div>

2.(12pts) Assume that the file myData.txt exists and contains only one line that says: "Hello World!". When users run the following program: (a) What do they see on their screen? and (b) What do they see in the file myData.txt?

<div markdown="1">
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
int main () {
	using namespace std;
	ofstream out_stream;
	int x = 55, y =66;
	
	out_stream.open("myData.txt");
	for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
		out_stream << x << y << endl;
	out_stream.close();
	
	cout << "File is written";
	return 0;
}
```
</div>

<div class="pagebreak"></div>

3.(5pts) What line(s) would you change in the program in question 2 (and what would the changes be), if you want the output file to be "myOtherData.txt" and you also wanted to ensure that your program-generated output stream was placed after the end of whatever was in that text file?
 <div style="margin-bottom:20em"></div>

4.(5pts) What additional code would you insert in the program in question 2 if you wanted to first check on the existence of the file "myData.txt" and then, if it did not exist, print out a message to the user about the file not existing and subsequently quitting the program? Indicate exactly where you would add this code to the existing code.
