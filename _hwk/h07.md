<b>PLEASE MARK YOUR HOMEWORK CLEARLY, REGARDLESS OF IF YOU WRITE IT OUT IN INK OR PENCIL!</b>
<ol markdown="1">

1.(10 pts) Which of these uses of type casting will NOT ensure that f is 1.5? Answer should be (ex1), (ex2), (ex3), or (ex4) (or a combination of those).

<div markdown="1">
```cpp
int a(1), b(2), c(2), d(2), e(2);
double f;

f = (a + b)*c / static_cast<double>(d + e);	// (ex1)
f = static_cast<double>(a + b)*c / (d + e);	// (ex2)
f = (a + b)*static_cast<double>(c) / (d + e);	// (ex3)
f = static_cast<double>((a + b)*(c) / (d + e));	// (ex4)
```
</div>

2.(10 pts) We talked about three concepts that are very important to keep straight, and not confuse: (a) function declaration, (b) function definition, and (c) function call. Here is a short C++ program, with line numbers. Please indicate after the program which line number (or range of line numbers, e.g. 3-5 or 7-14) contains the function prototype, function definition, and function call for the isDivisibleBy function.
  <div style="margin-bottom:1em"></div>
  
<div markdown="1">
```cpp
1  #include <iostream>
2  using namespace std;
3
4  bool isDivisibleBy(int a, int b);
5
6  int main() {
7     cout << "result for (15,5) is " << isDivisibleBy(5,15) << endl;
8     cout << "result for (15,5) is " << isDivisibleBy(5,15) << endl;
9     return 0;
10  }
11
12  bool isDivisibleBy(int a, int b) {
13    return ( a % b == 0 );
14  }
```
</div>
  
  <div class="pagebreak"></div>

3.(10 pts) Write a function declaration and a function definition for a function that takes one argument of type int and one argument of type double, and that returns a value of type double that is the average of the two arguments?
  <div style="margin-bottom:20em"></div>

4.(10 pts) Write a void function that takes in 2 arguments (integer n and string s) and produces a print out of the string 
s n times.
