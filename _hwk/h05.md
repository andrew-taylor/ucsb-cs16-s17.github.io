Read Chapter 2 and Ch 3 (If you do not have a co^py of the textbook yet, there is one on reserve at the library under "COMP000-STAFF - Permanent Reserve").

<b>PLEASE MARK YOUR HOMEWORK CLEARLY, REGARDLESS OF IF YOU WRITE IT OUT IN INK OR PENCIL!</b>

<ol markdown="1">

1. (1 pts) What is a run-time error?
	<div style="margin-bottom:6em"></div>

2. (2 pts) You are writing a program that keeps track of a bank account for your customers.
	The program must print out a statement on the computer display that warns the customer that their 
	balance is below $25, but only if they are a "premiere" customer. Which of these choices is correct? 
	Explain WHY?
	<div style="margin-bottom:1em"></div> 
	        
<div markdown="1">
```
A.  if (balance < 25) { cout << "Your balance is under $25 - be careful!"; }

B.  if !((balance > 25) || (type != "premiere")) { cout << "Your balance is under $25 - be careful!"; }

C.  if ((balance < 25) && (type == "premiere")) { cout << "Your balance is under $25 - be careful!"; }

D.  if (!(balance > 25) && (type == "premiere")) { cout << "Your balance is under $25 - be careful!"; }

```
</div>
	<div style="margin-bottom:8em"></div>

3. (7 pts) What will this piece of code print out exactly?
<div markdown="1">
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main () {
	int x(12);
	while (x >= 1) { 
		cout << x << " "; 
		if (!(x % 3)) {
			cout << "Buzz! ";
			if ((x % 2) == 0) cout << "Fizz!"; 
		}
		else cout << " ...";
		cout << endl;
		x--;
	}	
	return 0;
}	
```
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom:8em"></div>

<div class="pagebreak"></div>

4. (10 pts) Find 5 mistakes in this C++ code, mark them (circle them, put an arrow, etc...), and label each as "logic" or "syntax" error:
<div markdown="1">
```cpp
#include <iostream>;
use namespace std;
int main () 
	    int a(0);b(0);
		cout << "Enter a number that is either 0 or 1: ";
		cin >> a;
		cout << "Enter another number that is less than 5: ";
		cin >> b;
		switch (a) { 
			case 0: 
			cout << "number is zero.\n"; 
			for (int i = 5; i != b; i++) {
				cout << "extra line " << i << endl;
			}
			break; 
			case 1: 
			cout << "number is one.\n"; 
			if (b > 5) {
				cout << "Han shot first!\n";
			}
			break; 
		}
		return;
```
</div>
	
4.	(20 pts) Write a program that first asks for the name of the user, then asks the user to enter 
	an angle between 0 and 180 degrees. If the user does not enter a correct number 
	the program must start over. Once the correct number is entered, then the program must ask the user 
	if it should calculate the sine, the cosine, or the tangent of the angle. If the user does not enter a 
	valid choice, then the program should ask the same question again. Once the choice is made, the 
	program must do the calculation and present the answer to the user.
	<div style="margin-bottom:1em"></div>
	You must use a switch statement in this program. You may use built-in functions in 
	the <strong>cmath</strong> library for the trigonometric functions. Print out this program on a separate page 
	and submit it attached to this homework assignment.
