<b>PLEASE MARK YOUR HOMEWORK CLEARLY, REGARDLESS OF IF YOU WRITE IT OUT IN INK OR PENCIL!</b>

<div markdown="1">

1.(4 pts) How does a recursive function know when to stop recursing?
<div style="margin-bottom:8em"></div>

2.(8 pts) What is a LIFO scheme and how does it relate to stacks?
<div style="margin-bottom:8em"></div>

3.(8 pts) What is stack overflow?

4.(20 pts) Write a recursive function program to find the *n*th element in the following arithmetic numerical sequence: **3, 11, 27, 59, 123, ...**

Hint: You first have to figure out what is the recursive pattern. You also have to identify the base case. If you cannot write out the program in the space provided below, then print out the program on a separate sheet of paper and attach that to this homework. Please do not use more than 1 page, one sided.

Some correct example outputs would look like this (there is no repeating loop - these are 2 separate runs):

```
Which element of the sequence would you like to know?
4
Element number 4 in the sequence is 59.


Which element of the sequence would you like to know?
7
Element number 7 in the sequence is 507.
```
