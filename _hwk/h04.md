Read Chapter 2 and Ch 3 (If you do not have a copy of the textbook yet, there is one on reserve at the library under "COMP000-STAFF - Permanent Reserve").

<b>PLEASE MARK YOUR HOMEWORK CLEARLY, REGARDLESS OF IF YOU WRITE IT OUT IN INK OR PENCIL!</b>

<ol markdown="1">
1.	(1 pts) Which Boolean operator, when used with 2 logic expressions, yields TRUE if either expression is TRUE?
  <div style="margin-bottom:3em"></div>

2.	(1 pts) What is wrong (if anything) with this C++ expression?
  <div style="margin-bottom:1em"></div>
  <div markdown="1">
```
if (size = 9)
   cout << "The size is too small";
```
  </div>
  <div style="margin-bottom:5em"></div>

3.	(2 pts) Show the output of this code if x is of type int.
<div markdown="1">
```
int x = 20;
while ( x > 0) {
   cout << x << endl;
   x = x â€“ 4;
 }
```
</div> 
 
4.	(2 pts) Write a while loop that prints out these 11 lines: 
<div markdown="1">
```
COUNTDOWN TO ZERO: 10
COUNTDOWN TO ZERO: 9
...
COUNTDOWN TO ZERO: 1
COUNTDOWN TO ZERO: LIFT OFF!
```
</div>
<div class="pagebreak"></div>

5.	(6 pts)  What is the result (i.e. TRUE or FALSE) of the following Boolean operations in C++, given that:</br>
	x = 7, y = 10, z = 12
	<div style="margin-bottom:0em"></div>
<div markdown="1">
	a) (x == 6)


	b) ((x == 6) || (y < 20))

	
	d) ((!(x < z) || (y > z)) && (z == 12) && (y == 10))
	
	.	
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom:2em"></div>

7. (6 pts) Use precedence rules to re-write the following expressions:
  <div style="margin-bottom:1em"></div>
	a) x / 4 - 3 == 1 || 62 * y > 0
  <div style="margin-bottom:4em"></div>
	b) m / n * n < 10 || --flag <= 0
  <div style="margin-bottom:4em"></div>
	c) z / m + n / v == 5 && b * c - d != 0 || g != f
  <div style="margin-bottom:4em"></div>

8.	(4 pts) What is the output of the following statements?
  <div markdown="1">
```
int s = 1;
do
     cout << s << " ";
while (s++ <= 5);
```
  </div>
  <div style="margin-bottom:5em"></div>

9.	(4 pts) Same question as above, but the last statement now reads:

  <div markdown="1">
```
while (++s <= 5);
```
  </div>
<div class="pagebreak"></div>

10.	(6 pts) Write a block of statements (like a function, but you don't have to write it like a function) that take three arguments of user inputs of type int and returns a Boolean TRUE if the arguments are in ascending order; otherwise, it returns false. You can use any type of C++ statement types that we've gone over in class so far to accomplish this goal. For example, the set of (1, 2, 3) returns TRUE, as does (5, 5, 8), but not (6, 6, 6), nor (10, 11, 4), etc...
  <div style="margin-bottom:25em"></div>

11. 	(8 pts) Write a block of statements (like a function, but you don't have to write it like a function) that will repeatedly ask the user to input a number, then print that number multiplied by 3. This repetition only stops when the user enters zero or any negative number as input.
