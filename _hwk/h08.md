<b>PLEASE MARK YOUR HOMEWORK CLEARLY, REGARDLESS OF IF YOU WRITE IT OUT IN INK OR PENCIL!</b>

1.(4 pts) What is a flag in a program and of what use is it?
  <div style="margin-bottom:8em"></div>

2.(4 pts) What is variable tracing and how can it be of value to a programmer?
    <div style="margin-bottom:8em"></div>

3.(4 pts) If you have to use a conditional branch in your program, when would you choose to use a switch statement?
    <div style="margin-bottom:8em"></div>

4.(4 pts) Consider the statement: "Every time the code of a loop in a program is changed, it should be retested". Is this good advice? Why or why not?
    <div style="margin-bottom:8em"></div>

5.(4 pts) In regards to using tabbed/indented code: why bother with it in C++ if most compilers do not care about it? (or is this actually a *trick question*?)
    <div style="margin-bottom:8em"></div>

  <div class="pagebreak"></div>

6.(20 pts) The following code is intended to calculate the average of the six consecutive odd numbers, starting from the number 1. However, it fails at doing so. You have to fix it so that it does what it is intended to do. Start by copying this code into a full C++ program and debug via variable tracing. Submit the fixed code WITH your variable tracing.

<div markdown="1">
```cpp
int sum(1), count(1); 
while (count <= 6) { 
	sum += (2*count + 1); 
	count++; 
} 
cout << "sum = " << sum << endl;
```
