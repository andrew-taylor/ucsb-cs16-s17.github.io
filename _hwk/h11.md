<b>PLEASE MARK YOUR HOMEWORK CLEARLY, REGARDLESS OF IF YOU WRITE IT OUT IN INK OR PENCIL!</b>

1.(2 pts) If I wanted my double type variables to be displayed in scientific notation, with a precision of 3 decimal places, and always have a plus (+) sign in front of positive numbers, what code should I include in my program before issuing a cout statement?
<div style="margin-bottom:5em"></div>

2.(4 pts) Show the output produced when the following line is executed (assume library <iomanip> is included in the program:

`cout << "*" << setw(3) << 12345 << "*" << endl;`

<div style="margin-bottom:4em"></div>

3.(4 pts) When testing for end of file, we talked about two methods. What are they and when is each used?
<div style="margin-bottom:6em"></div>

4.(10 pts) I have a text file called "t.txt" that contains two entries: "UC Santa Barbara" on one line, and "Computer Science" on the other line. Show the output produced when the following code (entire program not shown) is executed. You are encouraged to also try to compile this in a program to verify your results.

<div markdown="1">
```cpp
  ifstream tin;
  tin.open("t.txt");
  char c = ' ';
  tin.get(c);
  while (!tin.eof()) {
    if ( (c != 'e') && (c != 'a') ) 
        cout << c;
  tin.get(c); }  // end while
```
</div>
<div class="pagebreak"></div>

5.(10 pts) Using the example shown in class in file <b>non_numbers.cpp</b>, extend the program (in the 2 relevant places) to check, not just for numbers, but for all alphanumeric characters (that is, numbers and letters). Attach your modified programs in a separate sheet to this homework assignment. 
<div style="margin-bottom:4em"></div>

6.(10 pts) Show the output produced when the following code (entire program not shown) is executed. You are encouraged to also try to compile this in a program to verify your results.

<div markdown="1">
```cpp
    string name = "Jeffery Tambor";

    cout << "NAME = " + name << endl;
    cout << name.length() << endl;

    name.erase(8, 6);
    cout << name << endl;
    name.append("Dean WD Morgan");
    cout << name << endl;

    name.insert(22, "@TWD");
    cout << name << endl;
    name.replace(23, 3, "The WD");
    cout << name << endl;

    cout << name.find("WD") << endl;
    cout << name.rfind("WD") << endl;
    cout << name.rfind("fery") << endl;

    for (int i = name.length(); i > 20; i--)
        cout << name[i-1];
    cout << endl;
```
</div>
