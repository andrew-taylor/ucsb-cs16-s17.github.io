<b>PLEASE MARK YOUR HOMEWORK CLEARLY, REGARDLESS OF IF YOU WRITE IT OUT IN INK OR PENCIL!</b>

<ol markdown="1">

You may print out your answers on a separate sheet(s) and attach them to this page when you turn in your homework.

1.(20 pts) Write a C++ program that creates a 2-dimensional array of 10x5 elements that are populated by random numbers between 0 and 49 (hint: use the rand() function and re-use code from the multi-dimensional array demonstration in class). The program should then ask the user for a number between 0 and 49 and searches the array for that number. If it finds it, it will return both indicies of the 2-D array, otherwise, it returns a message that says "I did not find this number." Re-run your
program multiple times to make sure that it works (it should show you different answers each time).
<div style="margin-bottom:1em"></div>

2. (5 pts) Run the search program that you made above 20 times. Everytime enter the **same** number between 0 and 49 to be searched. Keep track of how many times the number was found amongst the random values of the 2-D array. What is the "found ratio" (that is, the number of times found divided by the total number of times you ran the program)?

3. (10 pts) Write a C++ program that creates a array of 100 elements that are populated by random numbers between 0 and 999 (hint: you can re-use a lot of code from the first problem!) Run the ascending sort algorithm on it - use the one demonstrated in class (and found on our website under the "demos" section). Try and estimate how long it took to run the sort. Now modify the program so that the array size is 1,000 elements and re-run the sort algorithm. Again, try and estimate how long it
took to run the sort - was it noticeably longer? One more time, modify the program for an array size of 10,000 elements, re-run and time the sort and answer the same question on how much longer it took. Your answers can be approximations.

4.(5 pts) Write a function called `swapFrontBack` that takes as input a vector of integers. The function should swap the first element in the vector with the last element in the vector. The function should check if the vector is empty to prevent errors.
